Target is a large retailer in the United States. It is facing some challenges, including:

- Competition from online retailers: Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world, and it is taking market share from Target.
- Changing customer expectations: Customers are increasingly demanding convenience and personalization, and Target is struggling to keep up.
- Labor costs: Target's labor costs are rising, and this is putting pressure on the company's margins.
- Regulations: Target is facing increasing regulations, both in the United States and abroad.

## Insights: The insights that I derived from my analysis of the Target business problem are as follows:
- sao paulo is the place from where we had a potential customer and have the highest orders placed
- caem, avai are the areas where we had a least no of customers and produces less revenue.
- 8, 5, 7 are the months with highest sales
- 9, 10, 12 are the months with lowest sales
- Afternoon, Morning, Night has a good number of active buyers.
- SP, RJ, MG has the highest sales
- GO, ES, DF has the low sales

## Recommendations: Based on my insights, I recommend that Target focus on the following areas:

- Increase the stocks in this area and showcase products which are relevant to buyers 
- Take a marketing team increase the awareness of the products that could benefit them.
- See the competition and try to do something innovative from competitor.
- Pick up the pain point and find the solution that could relate our domain and create a relief for the customers.
- In the high growing months try to keep the stocks full for the products that are sold at high pace and try to showcase products that are less sold because the probability of selling the items in these months increases
- In the low selling months try to maintain only those stocks which has a high demand
- Try to maintain servers and take care of traffic, as traffic increases the database efficiency decreases that could create a loss of customers
